# Weather-App
Final Project Weather App

I've included a lot of comments in each file to try and help everyone know where to make edits. Basically, 

-Model is what manipulates our data. The .php files connect to our database AND the openweather API to pull the information and you can find any SQL manipulation there. There are many areas that can be improved. All SQL is stand-in and doesn't really include everthing we'll need.

-View is our UI, representing what users see and interact with.

-The controller is our intermediate layer between the two. It acts as sort of the methods behind the UI that interact with our Model. It determines what functions to call based on input.
